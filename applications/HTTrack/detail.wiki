==Features of HTTrack 3.47.27==
# It allows you to download a World Wide Web site from the Internet to a local directory, building recursively all directories, getting HTML, images, and other files from the server to your computer.
# HTTrack arranges the original site's relative link-structure. 
# Simply open a page of the "mirrored" website in your browser, and you can browse the site from link to link, as if you were viewing it online. 
# HTTrack can also update an existing mirrored site, and resume interrupted downloads. 
# HTTrack is fully configurable, and has an integrated help system.
# WinHTTrack is the Windows 2000/XP/Vista/Seven release of HTTrack, and WebHTTrack the Linux/Unix/BSD release.
