==Features of Alliance 1.0.6==
#Alliance is free and open source. It works on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. Alliance is completely decentralized. 
#It is easy to use and free.
#Technically Alliance takes the best parts of BitTorrent (advanced multi-source downloading), DirectConnect (community) and WASTE (security).
#With Alliance users create their own networks. You can either start a new network or get invited into an existing network by another Alliance user.
#Chat with your coworkers or friends in a secure and private way.
#Notice that you can send links in the chat that point to files in your Alliance network. 
#Search for files in your network of coworkers or friends using the decentralized high-speed search engine. 
#Download files securely and at high speeds. File transfers use BitTorrent-like technology. Files can be downloaded from multiple sources and uploaded to others at the same time. 
#Encryption is an important part of Alliance. Robust encryption (AES over SSL) has been implemented and is available as an experimental option in Alliance. By default Alliance runs on a very simplistic encryption algorithm. Even with the simple encryption Alliance is more secure than normal P2P networks since you only connect to your trusted friends.
